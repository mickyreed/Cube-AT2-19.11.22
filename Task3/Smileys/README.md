# README

This little project is a demonstration of certain OO concepts.

It revolves around "smileys" and can be used on the SenseHat.

It shows the four pillars of Object-Oriented programming in different ways:
1. Abstraction
2. Polymorphism (in multiple ways)
3. Inheritance (by subclassing a common Smiley class)
4. Encapsulation (e.g., we hide the SenseHat)

Students are encouraged to play around with the files to get a feel for what's going on
